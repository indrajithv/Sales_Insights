# Sales_Insights
Problem Statement : 
AtliQ Hardware has head office in Delhi and branches across India. The sales director notices a decline in sales and the regional managers are not helpful enough to figure out the reason. Hence, he decides to invest in a data analysis project, and he would like to build a Power BI dashboard to get sales insights. So create an automated Dashboard with a real-time refresh rate, providing insights that help in decision-making.
